# Raspberry Pi hardware

## Start pigpiod automatically

The service expects pigpiod at `/usr/local/bin/pigpiod` and its library installed.
Copy `pigpiod.service` from this folder to the Raspberry Pi Desktop, then run:

```bash
sudo install -m 644 ~/Desktop/pigpiod.service /etc/systemd/system/pigpiod.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
```

Stop the Thonny test and save your work, then reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Enabling without starting avoids conflicting with the manually started daemon.
After reboot, check:

```bash
systemctl is-active pigpiod
python3 -c "import pigpio; pi = pigpio.pi('localhost'); print('Connected:', pi.connected); pi.stop()"
```

Expected: `active` and `Connected: True`. If it fails:

```bash
journalctl -u pigpiod -b --no-pager -n 30
```

Only pigpiod starts automatically; run `test_locker.py` separately in Thonny.
The service accepts local socket connections only and disables the FIFO interface.
See the [pigpiod options](https://github.com/joan2937/pigpio/blob/master/pigpiod.1).
